# UniCar – University Carpooling Application

Functional prototype of a university carpooling application developed as a Final Undergraduate Project (TCC)  
in the Interdisciplinary Bachelor’s Degree in Science and Technology (BICT) at UNIFAL-MG, Brazil.

---

## 📌 Overview

UniCar is a mobile application prototype designed to address mobility challenges within a university environment.
The system allows students to offer and request carpools in a structured, organized, and controlled manner.

The project focuses on **system architecture**, **business logic**, **data modeling**, and **user flow management**,
rather than production deployment.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Design a functional carpooling system for academic environments
- Apply software engineering principles in a mobile context
- Model business rules and data consistency constraints
- Integrate cloud-based persistence with local state management
- Document architectural and technical decisions clearly

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- User registration and authentication
- Carpool offer creation and management
- Dynamic visualization of available carpools
- Seat availability control
- Boarding point selection
- Passenger–driver communication via WhatsApp
- Hybrid data persistence (Firebase + TinyDB)

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application follows a modular and event-driven architecture, composed of:

- **Presentation Layer**: Screen-based UI implemented in MIT App Inventor
- **Business Logic Layer**: Validation rules, offer lifecycle control, and state management
- **Data Layer**: Firebase Realtime Database and local persistence via TinyDB

A complete architectural description is available in `/docs/architecture.md`.
