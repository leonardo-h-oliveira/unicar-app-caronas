# Academic Context

This document describes the academic context in which the UniCar project was conceived, developed, and evaluated.

---

## Project Origin

UniCar was developed as a **Final Undergraduate Project (Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso – TCC)** for the Interdisciplinary Bachelor’s Degree in Science and Technology (BICT) at the **Federal University of Alfenas (UNIFAL-MG)**, Brazil.

The project was carried out within an academic environment, with the primary objective of applying theoretical and practical concepts related to:
- Programming logic
- Systems development
- Data modeling
- Mobile application architecture

---

## Academic Objectives

The main academic goals of the project included:

- Designing a functional system to address a real-world problem faced by the university community.
- Applying software engineering principles in a constrained development environment.
- Demonstrating the ability to model data, business rules, and user flows.
- Integrating cloud-based services into a mobile application prototype.

---

## Development Environment

The application was developed using **MIT App Inventor**, a block-based programming platform suitable for rapid prototyping and educational purposes.

Firebase Realtime Database was adopted as the backend service to support:
- User data storage
- Carpool offer management
- Seat availability control

Local persistence was implemented using TinyDB to support navigation continuity and session state management.

---

## Scope and Limitations

As an academic prototype, UniCar was developed with the following constraints:

- The application was not intended for production deployment.
- No formal scalability or performance testing was conducted.
- Security rules were implemented at a basic level, suitable for prototype validation.
- The system prioritizes clarity of logic and architecture over optimization.

These limitations were considered acceptable within the academic scope of the project.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

The project was evaluated based on:

- Functional correctness of the implemented features
- Consistency of the data model and business rules
- Clarity of system architecture and user flow
- Documentation quality and technical justification of decisions

---

## Academic Contribution

The UniCar project demonstrates:

- Practical application of theoretical concepts learned throughout the BICT program.
- Ability to structure and document a complete software system.
- Integration of multiple technologies into a cohesive solution.
- Awareness of design trade-offs and system constraints.

---

## Transition to Portfolio Project

After academic evaluation, the UniCar repository was reorganized and expanded to serve as a **technical portfolio project**.

This transition included:
- Documentation refactoring to English
- Modular architectural descriptions
- Clear separation between academic context and professional presentation

This allows the project to be evaluated both as an academic work and as a demonstration of software engineering skills.

---

## Summary

UniCar originated as an academic project and evolved into a documented system prototype.
Its academic foundation provided a structured environment for learning and experimentation,
while its final organization supports professional portfolio presentation.
