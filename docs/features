# Application Features

The UniCar application implements a complete academic prototype for university carpooling management. Its features were designed to cover the full lifecycle of a shared ride, from offer creation to passenger–driver communication.

All features are implemented using event-driven logic and cloud-based data synchronization.

---

## User Management

### User Registration
- Allows users to create an account within the application.
- User data is stored in Firebase under a structured user identifier.
- The same registration applies to both drivers and passengers.

### User Authentication
- Login mechanism validates registered users.
- Authentication controls access to protected application screens.
- User identification is reused throughout the system to associate offers and selections.

---

## Carpool Offer Management

### Create Carpool Offer
- Drivers can register new carpool offers by providing:
  - Number of available seats
  - Departure time
  - Route and destination information
- Offer data is validated and organized using structured dictionaries.
- Each offer receives a unique identifier.

### Store Offers in Cloud Database
- Offers are stored in Firebase Realtime Database.
- The system maintains a global counter for registered offers.
- The offer creation date is automatically recorded.

### Reset Offer Form
- After successful registration, input fields are cleared.
- The system is prepared for new offer creation without manual reset.

## Carpool Visualization and Selection

### Load Available Offers
- Available carpools are dynamically loaded from Firebase.
- Offers are displayed using list visualization components.
- Only valid and active offers are shown to passengers.

### Offer Selection
- Passengers can select a carpool from a list.
- A confirmation dialog is displayed before proceeding.
- The system validates seat availability before confirmation.

### Seat Availability Control
- When a passenger confirms a selection:
  - Available seats are reduced by one.
  - Updated data is saved back to Firebase.
- Prevents overbooking and ensures data consistency.

## Local State Management

### Temporary Data Storage
- TinyDB is used to store:
  - Selected offer identifiers
  - Offer details required across screens
- Ensures continuity during navigation between screens.

### Offline Tolerance
- Local storage reduces dependency on repeated cloud queries.
- Improves application responsiveness.

## Boarding Point Selection

### Boarding Point Interface
- Passengers select a boarding point from predefined options.
- Options are loaded dynamically based on the selected offer.

### Boarding Point Validation
- Ensures compatibility between the selected route and boarding point.
- Updates internal messaging data accordingly.

---

## Driver Communication

### Personalized WhatsApp Messaging
- Automatically generates a personalized message to the driver.
- Message includes:
  - Passenger intent
  - Selected boarding point
  - Contextual greeting
- Opens WhatsApp directly with pre-filled content.

### External Application Integration
- Uses Android intents to launch WhatsApp.
- Ensures seamless transition from UniCar to external communication.

---

## User Feedback and Notifications

### System Alerts
- Provides real-time feedback for:
  - Successful offer creation
  - Confirmation of carpool selection
  - Error handling and cancellation
- Improves user experience and clarity of actions.

---

## Academic and Technical Scope

- Fully functional academic prototype.
- Focus on business logic and data flow.
- Not intended for production deployment.
- Designed for conceptual validation and learning.

---

## Extensibility

The current feature set allows future expansion, including:
- Ratings and feedback systems
- Route optimization
- Push notifications
- Migration to native or cross-platform frameworks
