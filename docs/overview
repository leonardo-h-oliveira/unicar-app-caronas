# Project Overview

UniCar is a functional prototype of a university carpooling application developed as a Final Undergraduate Project (TCC) in the Interdisciplinary Bachelor’s Degree in Science and Technology (BICT) at the Federal University of Alfenas (UNIFAL-MG), Brazil.

The project was designed to apply concepts of programming logic, system development, and data modeling to a real-world problem faced by the academic community: student mobility.

UniCar focuses on the organization and management of shared carpool offers, allowing students to offer rides, search for available carpools, manage seats, and communicate efficiently with drivers.

The application was implemented using block-based programming through MIT App Inventor and integrates cloud services via Firebase for authentication and real-time data storage.

Although fully functional, UniCar was developed as an academic prototype and was not released for production use.
