UniCar – University Carpooling Application
Context

UniCar is a functional prototype of a carpooling application developed as a Final Undergraduate Project (TCC)
in the Interdisciplinary Bachelor’s Degree in Science and Technology (BICT) at the Federal University of Alfenas (UNIFAL-MG).

The project aimed to apply concepts of programming logic, systems development, and data modeling to a real problem within the university community.

Problem

University students face mobility-related challenges such as:

High cost of individual transportation

Lack of integration among students who share similar routes

Low predictability and safety in informal carpooling arrangements

Proposed Solution

Development of an application that allows:

User registration and authentication

Offering and searching for carpools

Management of available seats in vehicles

Real-time control of carpool availability

The system was designed as a functional academic prototype, focusing on business logic and data flow structuring.

Implemented Features

User registration

Login with authentication

Creation, editing, and removal of carpool offers

Addition and removal of passengers

Automatic control of available seats

Integration with a cloud-based database (Firebase)

Technologies Used

MIT App Inventor

Firebase Authentication

Firebase Realtime Database

Block-based programming logic

System Architecture and Flow

The application was structured with a clear separation between the user interface, business logic, and data layer.
Communication with Firebase enables the storage and retrieval of user information, carpools, and seat availability.

(System flow diagrams and images)

Project Status

Functional prototype developed in an academic context.
The application was not released to production nor made available to end users.

Key Learnings

System modeling focused on real-world problems

Implementation of authentication and user control

Structuring of business rules

Integration with cloud-based databases

Organization of a development project from start to finish

Core Logic in Python (Portfolio)

In addition to the App Inventor prototype, this repository includes a Python implementation
of the system’s core logic (seat management, entry/exit, and cancellation).
